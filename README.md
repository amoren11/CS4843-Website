* This website was built using HTML files along with several image files of animals and a single mp4 video file of a dancing gorilla. 
* All website files were stored in an Amazon S3 bucket with public access. 
* I set up IAM policies to secure the bucket and allowed ClourdFront to access the bucket contents and speed up the overall content delivery.
